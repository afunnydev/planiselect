    **Cabinet (racks)**: Hammond, Sysracks, Panduit, Electron Metal and more.
    Self-supporting model, screwed to the floor or fixed to the wall. New or
    used. A complete range of rack that will meet your structured cabling needs.


    **Switches**: A network switch is a device that connects several segments
    (cables or fibers) in a computer and telecommunication network and that
    makes it possible to create virtual circuits.


    **Patch panel**: The patch panel, an important item in any network, allows a
    clear and organized structure in addition to being easier to maintain.

    **Patch cord**: This small wiring link between the patch panel and the
    switch, when of the proper length, allows a clearer visual organization of
    the assembly in the rack. Like the cables, the cords are available in
    several colors. The assignment of colors, when there are several services
    using cable networks in a building, allows clear identification by the
    technician and avoids unpleasant service interruptions.


    **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)**: An important element in a network.
    It is used to regulate the current and keep the load on sensitive equipment
    or that must remain in operation long enough to allow a safe power off if
    the power outage is to last longer.

    The main clientele for intercoms are schools. Planiselect Inc. is pleased to
    have several schools and school boards to its credit. We work exclusively
    with TOA products. The quality of their products allows us smooth
    installations. **Planiselect is TOA certified.**

    When installing in new establishments, the challenges are mainly related to
    time constraints. When we have to work in an existing school, the attention
    is rather focused on the class schedule, the restrictions of the building
    and the presence of asbestos.


    The system installation usually includes the following elements:


    * TOA Intercom system
    
    * Asterisk IP Intercom system
    
    * VOIP Door Intercom system
    
    * IP CLOCK system
