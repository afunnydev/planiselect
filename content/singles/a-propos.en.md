      Bell Canada invites Robert Paquette to bid for a phone cabling contract.
      He founds "Installation of Cables R.P." and obtains the contract. With his
      son, Alain Paquette, he will make phone cabling for the city of Laval,
      where he will then settle on Alexandre Street. Soon, the company wins the
      contract for East Montreal, and then downtown. Installation of Cables R.P.
      will increase from 1 to 22 installation teams from 1979 to 1989. Fun fact:
      their contract with Bell will lead them to make the call services on the
      residential side, like changing the small light bulbs in the Princess
      phones. They will also do the phone booths maintenance.
